### Introduction

This assignment uses data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, a popular repository for machine learning datasets. In particular, we will be using the "Individual household electric power consumption Data Set" which I have made available on the course web site:

    Dataset: Electric power consumption [20Mb]

    Description: Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.

The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken from the UCI web site:

    Date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy
    Time: time in format hh:mm:ss
    Global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)
    Global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)
    Voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)
    Global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)
    Sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).
    Sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.
    Sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.

### Methodology

Each R script will generate the respective plot as required inthe assignment. However, in order to run the file as it exists in the repository, the working directory stated at the beginning of the four files needs to be adjusted so that it reflects the environment where the files reside. In order to accomplish this task, the files will need to be opened with a text editor and the required changes made.

The script will download the data from the website url where the data currently exists, unzip the data file and then extract the data necessary for the assignment. Once extracted the data is converted into the correct format and the repsective plots are executed. Each script is a stand alone program to go get the data and execute the respective plot.

The assignment description is taken for the instructions for the assignment which is available at https://www.coursera.org/learn/exploratory-data-analysis/peer/ylVFo/course-project-1.
